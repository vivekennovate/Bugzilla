      Whining is a feature in Bugzilla that can regularly annoy users at 
      specified times.  Using this feature, users can execute saved searches 
      at specific times (i.e. the 15th of the month at midnight) or at 
      regular intervals (i.e. every 15 minutes on Sundays).  The results of the
      searches are sent to the user, either as a single email or as one email 
      per bug, along with some descriptive text.
    </p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="../images/warning.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
        Throughout this section it will be assumed that all users are members 
        of the bz_canusewhines group, membership in which is required in order 
        to use the Whining system.  You can easily make all users members of 
        the bz_canusewhines group by setting the User RegExp to ".*" (without 
        the quotes).
      </p><p>
        Also worth noting is the bz_canusewhineatothers group.  Members of this
        group can create whines for any user or group in Bugzilla using a 
        extended form of the whining interface.  Features only available to 
        members of the bz_canusewhineatothers group will be noted in the 
        appropriate places.

        For whining to work, a special Perl script must be executed at regular
        intervals.  More information on this is available in 
        <a class="xref" href="extraconfig.html#installation-whining" title="2.3.3. Whining">Section 2.3.3, “Whining”</a>.

        This section does not cover the whineatnews.pl script.  See
        <a class="xref" href="extraconfig.html#installation-whining-cron" title="2.3.2. The Whining Cron">Section 2.3.2, “The Whining Cron”</a> for more information on

        The whining system defines an "Event" as one or more queries being 
        executed at regular intervals, with the results of said queries (if
        there are any) being emailed to the user.  Events are created by 
        clicking on the "Add new event" button.
      </p><p>
        Once a new event is created, the first thing to set is the "Email 
        subject line".  The contents of this field will be used in the subject
        line of every email generated by this event.  In addition to setting a 
        subject, space is provided to enter some descriptive text that will be 
        included at the top of each message (to help you in understanding why 
        you received the email in the first place).
      </p><p>
        The next step is to specify when the Event is to be run (the Schedule) 
        and what searches are to be performed (the Searches).
      </p></div><div class="section" title="5.13.2. Whining Schedule"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="whining-schedule"></a>5.13.2. Whining Schedule</h3></div></div></div><p>
         Each whining event is associated with zero or more schedules.  A 
         schedule is used to specify when the query (specified below) is to be
         run.  A new event starts out with no schedules (which means it will 
         never run, as it is not scheduled to run).  To add a schedule, press
         the "Add a new schedule" button.
      </p><p>
         Each schedule includes an interval, which you use to tell Bugzilla 
         when the event should be run.  An event can be run on certain days of
         the week, certain days of the month, during weekdays (defined as 
         Monday through Friday), or every day.
      </p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="../images/warning.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          Be careful if you set your event to run on the 29th, 30th, or 31st of
          the month, as your event may not run exactly when expected.  If you 
          want your event to run on the last day of the month, select "Last day
          of the month" as the interval.
        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        Once you have specified the day(s) on which the event is to be run, you
        should now specify the time at which the event is to be run.  You can 
        have the event run at a certain hour on the specified day(s), or 
        every hour, half-hour, or quarter-hour on the specified day(s).
      </p><p>
        If a single schedule does not execute an event as many times as you 
        would want, you can create another schedule for the same event.  For 
        example, if you want to run an event on days whose numbers are
        divisible by seven, you would need to add four schedules to the event,
        setting the schedules to run on the 7th, 14th, 21st, and 28th (one day 
        per schedule) at whatever time (or times) you choose.
      </p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          If you are a member of the bz_canusewhineatothers group, then you
          will be presented with another option: "Mail to".  Using this you 
          can control who will receive the emails generated by this event.  You
          can choose to send the emails to a single user (identified by email 
          address) or a single group (identified by group name).  To send to 
          multiple users or groups, create a new schedule for each additional 
          user/group.
        </p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="section" title="5.13.3. Whining Searches"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="whining-query"></a>5.13.3. Whining Searches</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Each whining event is associated with zero or more searches.  A search
        is any saved search to be run as part of the specified schedule (see
        above).  You start out without any searches associated with the event
        (which means that the event will not run, as there will never be any
        results to return).  To add a search, press the "Include search" button.
      </p><p>
        The first field to examine in your newly added search is the Sort field.
        Searches are run, and results included, in the order specified by the
        Sort field.  Searches with smaller Sort values will run before searches
        with bigger Sort values.
      </p><p>
        The next field to examine is the Search field.  This is where you 
        choose the actual search that is to be run.  Instead of defining search
        parameters here, you are asked to choose from the list of saved 
        searches (the same list that appears at the bottom of every Bugzilla 
        page).  You are only allowed to choose from searches that you have 
        saved yourself (the default saved search, "My Bugs", is not a valid 
        choice).  If you do not have any saved searches, you can take this 
        opportunity to create one (see <a class="xref" href="query.html#list" title="5.5.4. Bug Lists">Section 5.5.4, “Bug Lists”</a>).
      </p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          When running queries, the whining system acts as if you are the user
          executing the query.  This means that the whining system will ignore
          bugs that match your query, but that you cannot access.
        </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        Once you have chosen the saved search to be executed, give the query a 
        descriptive title.  This title will appear in the email, above the 
        results of the query.  If you choose "One message per bug", the query 
        title will appear at the top of each email that contains a bug matching
        your query.
      </p><p>
        Finally, decide if the results of the query should be sent in a single
        email, or if each bug should appear in its own email.
      </p><div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" src="../images/warning.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          Think carefully before checking the "One message per bug" box.  If
          you create a query that matches thousands of bugs, you will receive 
          thousands of emails!
        </p></td></tr></table></div></div><div class="section" title="5.13.4. Saving Your Changes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="idp7758112"></a>5.13.4. Saving Your Changes</h3></div></div></div><p>
        Once you have defined at least one schedule, and created at least one 
        query, go ahead and "Update/Commit".  This will save your Event and make
        it available for immediate execution.
      </p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
          If you ever feel like deleting your event, you may do so using the 
          "Remove Event" button in the upper-right corner of each Event.  You 
          can also modify an existing event, so long as you "Update/Commit" 
          after completing your modifications.
