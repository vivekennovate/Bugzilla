    <a class="glossterm" href="glossary.html#gloss-product"><em class="glossterm">
    Products</em></a> typically represent real-world
    shipping products. Products can be given 
    <a class="xref" href="classifications.html" title="3.3. Classifications">Classifications</a>. 
    For example, if a company makes computer games, 
    they could have a classification of "Games", and a separate
    product for each game. This company might also have a 
    <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Common</span>”</span> product for units of technology used 
    in multiple games, and perhaps a few special products that
    represent items that are not actually shipping products 
    (for example, "Website", or "Administration").
    </p><p>
    Many of Bugzilla's settings are configurable on a per-product
    basis. The number of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">votes</span>”</span> available to 
    users is set per-product, as is the number of votes
    required to move a bug automatically from the UNCONFIRMED 
    status to the CONFIRMED status.

      turned on, a table of existing classifications is displayed,
      including an "Unclassified" category. The table indicates how many products
      are in each classification. Click on the classification name to see its
      products. If the 'useclassification' parameter is not in use, the table 
      lists all products directly. The product table summarizes the information 
      about the product defined
      when the product was created. Click on the product name to edit these

        On the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Edit Product</span>”</span> page, there is a link called 
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Edit Group Access Controls</span>”</span>. The settings on this page 
        control the relationship of the groups to the product being edited.
        </p><p>
        Group Access Controls are an important aspect of using groups for 
        isolating products and restricting access to bugs filed against those
        products. For more information on groups, including how to create, edit
        add users to, and alter permission of, see <a class="xref" href="groups.html" title="3.15. Groups and Group Security">Section 3.15, “Groups and Group Security”</a>.
        </p><p>
        After selecting the "Edit Group Access Controls" link from the "Edit
        Product" page, a table containing all user-defined groups for this 
        Bugzilla installation is displayed. The system groups that are created
        when Bugzilla is installed are not applicable to Group Access Controls.
        Below is description of what each of these fields means.
        </p><p>
        Groups may be applicable (e.g bugs in this product can be associated
        with this group) , default (e.g. bugs in this product are in this group
        by default), and mandatory (e.g. bugs in this product must be associated
        with this group) for each product. Groups can also control access 
        to bugs for a given product, or be used to make bugs for a product 
        totally read-only unless the group restrictions are met. The best way to
        understand these relationships is by example. See 
        <a class="xref" href="products.html#group-control-examples" title="3.4.4.1. Common Applications of Group Controls">Section 3.4.4.1, “Common Applications of Group Controls”</a> for examples of 
        product and group relationships.
        </p><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
            Products and Groups are not limited to a one-to-one relationship. 
            Multiple groups can be associated with the same product, and groups
            can be associated with more than one product. 
          </p></td></tr></table></div><p>
        If any group has <span class="emphasis"><em>Entry</em></span> selected, then the 
        product will restrict bug entry to only those users 
        who are members of <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the groups with 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Entry</em></span> selected.
        </p><p>
        If any group has <span class="emphasis"><em>Canedit</em></span> selected, 
        then the product will be read-only for any users 
        who are not members of <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> of the groups with
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Canedit</em></span> selected. <span class="emphasis"><em>Only</em></span> users who 
        are members of all the <span class="emphasis"><em>Canedit</em></span> groups 
        will be able to edit bugs for this product. This is an additional 
        restriction that enables finer-grained control over products rather 
        than just all-or-nothing access levels.
        </p><p>
        The following settings let you 
        choose privileges on a <span class="emphasis"><em>per-product basis</em></span>.
        This is a convenient way to give privileges to 
        some users for some products only, without having 
        to give them global privileges which would affect 
        all products.
        </p><p>
        Any group having <span class="emphasis"><em>editcomponents</em></span> 
        selected  allows users who are in this group to edit all 
        aspects of this product, including components, milestones 
        and versions.
        </p><p>
        Any group having <span class="emphasis"><em>canconfirm</em></span> selected 
        allows users who are in this group to confirm bugs 
        in this product.
        </p><p>
        Any group having <span class="emphasis"><em>editbugs</em></span> selected allows 
        users who are in this group to edit all fields of 
        bugs in this product.
        </p><p>
        The <span class="emphasis"><em>MemberControl</em></span> and 
        <span class="emphasis"><em>OtherControl</em></span> are used in tandem to determine which 
        bugs will be placed in this group. The only allowable combinations of
        these two parameters are listed in a table on the "Edit Group Access Controls"
        page. Consult this table for details on how these fields can be used.
        Examples of different uses are described below.
        </p><div class="section" title="3.4.4.1. Common Applications of Group Controls"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="group-control-examples"></a>3.4.4.1. Common Applications of Group Controls</h4></div></div></div><p>
        The use of groups is best explained by providing examples that illustrate
        configurations for common use cases. The examples follow a common syntax:
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Group: Entry, MemberControl, OtherControl, CanEdit,
        EditComponents, CanConfirm, EditBugs</em></span>. Where "Group" is the name
        of the group being edited for this product. The other fields all
        correspond to the table on the "Edit Group Access Controls" page. If any
        of these options are not listed, it means they are not checked.      
      </p><p>
            Basic Product/Group Restriction
          </p><p>
          Suppose there is a product called "Bar". The 
          "Bar" product can only have bugs entered against it by users in the
          group "Foo". Additionally, bugs filed against product "Bar" must stay
          restricted to users to "Foo" at all times. Furthermore, only members
          of group "Foo" can edit bugs filed against product "Bar", even if other
          users could see the bug. This arrangement would achieved by the
          following:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
Product Bar: 
foo: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY, CANEDIT
        </pre><p>
          Perhaps such strict restrictions are not needed for product "Bar". A 
          more lenient way to configure product "Bar" and group "Foo" would be:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
Product Bar: 
foo: ENTRY, SHOWN/SHOWN, EDITCOMPONENTS, CANCONFIRM, EDITBUGS
        </pre><p>
          The above indicates that for product "Bar", members of group "Foo" can
          enter bugs. Any one with permission to edit a bug against product "Bar"
          can put the bug
          in group "Foo", even if they themselves are not in "Foo". Anyone in group
          "Foo" can edit all aspects of the components of product "Bar", can confirm
          bugs against product "Bar", and can edit all fields of any bug against
          product "Bar".
        </p><p>
            General User Access With Security Group
          </p><p>
               To permit any user to file bugs against "Product A",
               and to permit any user to submit those bugs into a
               group called "Security":  
            </p><pre class="programlisting"> 
Product A:
security: SHOWN/SHOWN
      </pre><p>
            General User Access With A Security Product
          </p><p>
            To permit any user to file bugs against product called "Security"
            while keeping those bugs from becoming visible to anyone
            outside the group "SecurityWorkers" (unless a member of the
            "SecurityWorkers" group removes that restriction):
          </p><pre class="programlisting"> 
Product Security:
securityworkers: DEFAULT/MANDATORY
          </pre><p>
            Product Isolation With a Common Group
          </p><p>
            To permit users of "Product A" to access the bugs for
            "Product A", users of "Product B" to access the bugs for 
            "Product B", and support staff, who are members of the "Support 
            Group" to access both, three groups are needed:
          </p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist" type="1"><li class="listitem"><p>Support Group: Contains members of the support staff.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>AccessA Group: Contains users of product A and the Support group.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>AccessB Group: Contains users of product B and the Support group.</p></li></ol></div><p>
            Once these three groups are defined, the product group controls
            can be set to:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
Product A:
AccessA: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Product B:
AccessB: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
        </pre><p>
         Perhaps the "Support Group" wants more control. For example, 
         the "Support Group"  could be permitted to make bugs inaccessible to 
         users of both groups "AccessA" and "AccessB". 
         Then, the "Support Group" could be permitted to publish
         bugs relevant to all users in a third product (let's call it 
         "Product Common") that is read-only
         to anyone outside the "Support Group". In this way the "Support Group" 
         could control bugs that should be seen by both groups. 
         That configuration would be:
        </p><pre class="programlisting">
Product A:
AccessA: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Support: SHOWN/NA
Product B:
AccessB: ENTRY, MANDATORY/MANDATORY
Support: SHOWN/NA
Product Common:
Support: ENTRY, DEFAULT/MANDATORY, CANEDIT
      </pre><p>
            Make a Product Read Only
          </p><p>
            Sometimes a product is retired and should no longer have
            new bugs filed against it (for example, an older version of a software
            product that is no longer supported). A product can be made read-only
            by creating a group called "readonly" and adding products to the
            group as needed:
          </p><pre class="programlisting">
Product A:
ReadOnly: ENTRY, NA/NA, CANEDIT
         </pre><div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em"><table border="0" summary="Note"><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" src="../images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p>
